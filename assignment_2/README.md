Data preprocessing noise standard deviations.

Original Average Noise Standard Deviation: 13.399395205973835

Smoothing on original Average Noise Standard Deviation: 6.213702415994948

Bm3d on original Average Noise Standard Deviation: 4.038434031532942

Bm3d plus smoothing Average Noise Standard Deviation: 3.84210272624973

Data preprocessing:
run preprocess.py, set directories accordingly 
run motion_compensation.py to perform images registration 

perform edge detection and segmenation on the images obtained from motion compensation
